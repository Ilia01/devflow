- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] CI/CD running on every commit
- [ ] Comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] Contributing guide
- [ ] 5+ people using it (team + external)

---

## Phase 1: Core Features (3-4 weeks)

### Feature 1.1: `devflow list` - List Assigned Tickets
**Branch:** `feature/list-tickets` ✅ MERGED (premature)
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Quick win, immediately useful)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add Jira API method to fetch assigned tickets (`GET /search`)
- [x] Parse and display tickets with colors
- [ ] Add filtering by status, project
- [x] Pretty terminal output (table format)
- [ ] Add `--json` flag for scripting
- [x] Unit tests for list logic
- [x] Integration test with mocked Jira API

**Usage:**
```bash
devflow list                    # All assigned tickets
devflow list --status "To Do"   # Filter by status
devflow list --project WAB      # Filter by project
devflow list --json             # JSON output for scripts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Your Assigned Tickets (3):

  WAB-1234  [In Progress]  Add user authentication
            Branch: feat/WAB-1234/add_user_authentication

  WAB-1235  [To Do]        Fix login bug

  WAB-1236  [In Review]    Update API documentation
            PR: https://github.com/...
```

**Technical Details:**
- Use Jira JQL: `assignee = currentUser() AND project = WAB`
- Color coding: Green=In Progress, Yellow=To Do, Blue=In Review
- Cache results for 5 minutes to reduce API calls

---

### Feature 1.2: `devflow open` - Open in Browser
**Branch:** `feature/open-browser` ✅ MERGED (premature)
**Effort:** 1 day
**Priority:** HIGH (Quick win, very convenient)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Detect current ticket from branch name
- [x] Build Jira ticket URL
- [x] Build GitHub/GitLab PR/MR URL
- [x] Cross-platform browser opening (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- [x] Add `--pr` flag to open PR instead of ticket
- [x] Add `--board` flag to open Jira board
- [x] Tests for URL generation logic

**Usage:**
```bash
devflow open           # Opens current ticket in Jira
devflow open WAB-1234  # Opens specific ticket
devflow open --pr      # Opens PR/MR for current branch
devflow open --board   # Opens Jira board
```

**Technical Details:**
- Use `open` crate for cross-platform browser opening
- Extract ticket ID from current branch name
- For PR: Search for PR by branch name via API
- Fallback to project board if no ticket found

---

### Feature 1.3: `devflow search` - Search Tickets
**Branch:** `feature/search-tickets` ✅ MERGED (premature)
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Complex but powerful)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Jira JQL search integration
- [x] Search by summary and description
- [x] Add filters (assignee, status, project)
- [x] Display results with colors and pagination
- [ ] Interactive selection (pick ticket to start work)
- [x] Tests for search query building
- [x] Handle no results gracefully

**Usage:**
```bash
devflow search "login bug"           # Search by text
devflow search --assignee me         # My tickets
devflow search --status "To Do"      # By status
devflow search "API" --project WAB   # Project specific
devflow search "auth" --interactive  # Pick ticket to start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Search Results (5 found):

  1. WAB-1234  [In Progress]  Add user authentication
  2. WAB-1235  [To Do]        Fix login bug
  3. WAB-1236  [In Review]    Update API docs
  4. WAB-1237  [To Do]        Login page redesign
  5. WAB-1238  [Blocked]      Auth service migration

Showing 5 of 12 results. Use --limit to see more.
```

**Technical Details:**
- Build JQL from search parameters
- Use Jira search API: `GET /rest/api/3/search`
- Default limit: 10 results
- Interactive mode: use `dialoguer` crate for selection

---

### Feature 1.4: Better Error Handling & Validation
**Branch:** `feature/error-handling` ✅ MERGED (premature)
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Essential for team adoption)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create custom error types (JiraError, GitError, ConfigError)
- [ ] Validate config during `init` (test API tokens work)
- [x] Check prerequisites before commands (git repo, clean tree)
- [x] User-friendly error messages with suggestions
- [x] Add `--verbose` flag for debugging
- [x] Recovery suggestions in error messages
- [ ] Tests for all error scenarios

**Error Message Examples:**
```
❌ Error: Not in a git repository
   Run devflow from inside a git project

❌ Error: Jira API authentication failed (401)
   Your API token may have expired.

   To fix:
   1. Generate new token: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
   2. Update config: devflow config edit
   3. Or reinitialize: devflow init

❌ Error: Branch 'feat/WAB-1234/...' already exists
   You're already on this branch.

   Run: devflow status

❌ Error: Uncommitted changes detected
   Commit or stash your changes before running 'devflow done'

   Run: git status
```

**Technical Details:**
- Custom error enum with context
- Use `anyhow::Context` for error chains
- Color-coded errors (red) with green suggestions
- Validate API tokens during init (make test call)
- Check `git status --porcelain` before `done`

---

### Feature 1.5: Complete Remaining Phase 1 Tasks
**Branch:** `feature/phase1-completion`
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Priority:** HIGH (Finish what we started)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `--status` and `--project` flags to `devflow list`
- [ ] Add `--json` flag to `devflow list` for scripting
- [ ] Add `--interactive` flag to `devflow search` (pick ticket to start)
- [ ] Validate config during `devflow init` (test API tokens actually work)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error scenario tests
- [ ] Update README with all completed features

**Why This Matters:**
We prematurely merged features before completing all tasks. This section addresses the technical debt created.

---

## Phase 2: Quality & Polish (2-3 weeks)

### Quality 2.1: Comprehensive Testing
**Effort:** 1 week
**Priority:** HIGH

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Unit tests for all commands (target 80% coverage)

- [ ] Test edge cases (no tickets, API errors, network issues)
- [ ] Test all error scenarios
- [ ] Add `cargo test --all-features`
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Document how to run tests in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Testing Strategy:**

**Unit Tests (per feature):**
- Command argument parsing
- Branch name generation
- Ticket ID extraction
- URL building
- Error handling logic

**Integration Tests:**
- Mock Jira API responses with `mockito`
- Mock GitHub/GitLab API responses
- Test full workflows (start → commit → done)
- Test error recovery

**Manual Test Scenarios (before release):**
1. Fresh install on clean machine
2. Run through all commands
3. Test error cases
4. Test with both GitHub and GitLab
5. Cross-platform testing (Mac, Linux, Windows)

## Notes

**Key Principles:**
1. **Quality over speed** - Take time to do it right
2. **Test everything** - No feature without tests
3. **Document as you go** - Don't leave docs for the end
4. **Ship incrementally** - Each feature is a win
5. **Get feedback early** - Share with team after each feature

**When to Ship:**
- When all success criteria met
- When you'd confidently share with your team
- When you're proud to put it on LinkedIn
- When strangers could use it without asking questions

**Remember:**
This is a learning project AND a portfolio piece. The journey matters as much as the destination. Document your learnings, share your struggles, and enjoy the process!
